# CouchDbReplicator
Really simple CouchDB replicator/backup.

This app currently replicates all user specified databases to another CouchDB installation. There is no auth support. This is used mainly as an automacted backup.

# Future Plans
- Choose which dbs to replicate
- Add auth support
- Backup/Replicate to multiple targets
